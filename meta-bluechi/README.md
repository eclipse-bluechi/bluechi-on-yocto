I. Adding the meta-bluechi layer to your build
=================================================

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer meta-bluechi'

II. Building an Image
=====================

This layer has a minimal image you can build by running: `bitbake bluechi-minimal`.

It needs the following configuration in your `local.conf` file:

```
DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " usrmerge systemd acl xattr pam"
DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED += "sysvinit"

VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = "systemd-compat-units"
```

The bluechi recipe will also include a basic single-node node configuration for testing purposes.

III. Selinux Support
====================

It's possible to build this layer with selinux support enabled but it has not being fully tested yet.
